          Hello ðŸ‘‹

        </span>
        <span className="mt-[28px] block text-left text-2xl font-light text-white">
          What that means? I am a{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">creative problem solver</span> that{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">loves to learn</span> and{" "}

        <span className="mt-[28px] block text-left text-2xl font-light text-white">
          And well, you probably heard that a thousand times from other people,
          so let me tell you a little bit more about me.

          Who is JoÃ£o? ðŸ‘½
        </span>
        <span className="mt-[28px] block text-left text-2xl font-light text-white">
          Well, there is no definition to that.
        </span>
        <span className="mt-[28px] block text-left text-2xl font-light text-white">
          Even though I am a very creative person, I am also a very logical
          person. I love to solve problems, and I love to create new things.
        </span>
        <span className="mt-[28px] block text-left text-2xl font-light text-white">
          This is just an example, but the thing is: people love to attach
          themselves to definitions, labels, boxes.
        </span>
        <span className="mt-[28px] block text-left text-2xl font-light text-white">
          And yeah {"that's"} understandable, we need some identification at
          some point, but this specialization {"don't"} please me at all.

        <span className="mt-[28px] block text-left text-2xl font-light text-white">
          So, since you probably {"don't"} know me, please let me tell you a
          little bit about me.

        <span className="mt-[28px] block text-left text-2xl font-light text-white">
          I am a 20 year old that loves fashion, art, music, design, techology,
          spirituality, conspiracy theories and a lot of other things.

        <span className="mt-[28px] block text-left text-2xl font-light text-white">
          My professional background until this point was focused on working as
          a Software Engineer. I have strong expertise as a full-stack
          (front-end heavy) developer with expertise in React, React Native,
          NodeJS, GraphQL, TypeScript, etc.
